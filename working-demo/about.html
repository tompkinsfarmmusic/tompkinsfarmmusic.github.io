            Welcome to the Farm!
        </p>
        What is Tompkins Farm Music?
        <p>
            Tompkins Farm Music is a boutique music publisher located in Westchester 
            County, NY. Established in 2017, the Farm focuses on the global 
            administration of copyrights. We develop meaningful relationships with 
            performance and mechanical societies, seek out synchronization 
            opportunities, and administer production music.
            <br><br>
            In a fast-paced world of constant technological change, the Farm is a 
            throwback to the older days of music publishers. Here, our people 
            answer phones, develop meaningful relationships with writers and have 
            a deep knowledge of the music in our catalog. The Farm is familiar 
            with the international landscape, popular music in different countries, 
            the major players in the industry, and the sync and advertising landscape. 
            <br><br>
            We’re open to songwriters of all shapes and sizes, all styles and time 
            periods. Our catalog is diverse, spanning multiple genres across several 
            decades, and dating back to the 1950s. The catalog’s earliest 
            compositions were recorded by iconic easy listening artists, such as 
            Perry Como and the Ray Charles Singers. Newer additions include more 
            contemporary styles such as hip hop, EDM, and indie rock.

        Trivia
        <p>
            The Farm is located in the neighborhood which was originally part of 
            the Noah Tompkins Farm in the Village of Mamaroneck, NY. Noah Tompkins 
            was a member of one of the earliest families to settle in Westchester 
            County, NY, and his farm dates back to 1644. Some folks in our 
            neighborhood believe that our office is located in the original Noah
            Tompkins farm house.
