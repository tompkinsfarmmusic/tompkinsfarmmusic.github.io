        writer-first approach
        <p>
            We focus on the best moves for writers to grow,
            and a personalized approach yields much better results.
            Writers get individual attention from the owner of the company,
            who knows the songs inside and out;
            we understand everyone has their own unique path to take.

        unmatched communication
        <p>
            Most publishers have cast aside real interaction in favor of automation,
            resulting in administrators not even knowing the songs in their catalog.
            Better decisions come from understanding the music and writers.
            At Tompkins Farm, songwriters always have direct contact with the owner
            of the company.  Transparency and trust are keys to success!

        effortless registration
        <p>
            Registering your works with collection agencies is convoluted and
            time-consuming, and you should be able to use that time on what really
            matters: your art.  Let us handle it for you.

        maximized revenue
        <p>
            Digital service providers are the name of the game in the 2020's,
            but too often songwriters only see a fraction of the revenue they
            could be collecting.  We can obtain these lost funds for you,
            increasing your revenue for every stream!

        exposure to supervisors
        <p>
            The importance of making your songs easy to find for supervisors
            cannot be overstated.  We have close relationships with award-winning
            music supervisors and coordinators, and exclusive access to
            state-of-the-art song databases!
