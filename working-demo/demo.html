            <h2>songwriter-first approach</h2>
            <p>
                We focus on the best moves for writers to grow,
                and a personalized approach yields much better results.
                Writers get individual attention from the owner of the company,
                who knows the songs inside and out;
                we understand everyone has their own unique path to take.

        <section id='intro--communication'>
            <h2>unmatched communication</h2>
            <p>
                Most publishers have cast aside real interaction in favor of automation,
                resulting in administrators not even knowing the songs in their catalog.
                Better decisions come from understanding the music and writers.
                At Tompkins Farm, songwriters always have direct contact with the owner
                of the company.  Transparency and trust are keys to success!

            <p>
                Registering your works with collection agencies is convoluted and
                time-consuming, and you should be able to use that time on what really
                matters: your art.  Let us handle it for you.

            <p>
                Digital service providers are the name of the game in the 2020's,
                but too often songwriters only see a fraction of the revenue they
                could be collecting.  We can obtain these lost funds for you,
                increasing your revenue for every stream!

                The importance of making your songs easy to find for supervisors
                cannot be overstated.  We have close relationships with award-winning
                music supervisors and coordinators, and exclusive access to

            <h2>what is tompkins farm music?</h2>
            <p>
                Tompkins Farm Music is a boutique music publisher located in Westchester 
                County, NY. Established in 2017, the Farm focuses on the global 
                administration of copyrights. We develop meaningful relationships with 
                performance and mechanical societies, seek out synchronization 
                opportunities, and administer production music.
                <br><br>
                In a fast-paced world of constant technological change, the Farm is a 
                throwback to the older days of music publishers. Here, our people 
                answer phones, develop meaningful relationships with writers and have 
                a deep knowledge of the music in our catalog. The Farm is familiar 
                with the international landscape, popular music in different countries, 
                the major players in the industry, and the sync and advertising landscape. 
                <br><br>
                We’re open to songwriters of all shapes and sizes, all styles and time 
                periods. Our catalog is diverse, spanning multiple genres across several 
                decades, and dating back to the 1950s. The catalog’s earliest 
                compositions were recorded by iconic easy listening artists, such as 
                Perry Como and the Ray Charles Singers. Newer additions include more 
                contemporary styles such as hip hop, EDM, and indie rock.

            <p>
                The Farm is located in the neighborhood which was originally part of 
                the Noah Tompkins Farm in the Village of Mamaroneck, NY. Noah Tompkins 
                was a member of one of the earliest families to settle in Westchester 
                County, NY, and his farm dates back to 1644. Some folks in our 
                neighborhood believe that our office is located in the original Noah
                Tompkins farm house.
